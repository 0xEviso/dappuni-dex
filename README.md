# Blockchain Masterclass from dapp university

Deploy and fill with placeholder data:

```shell
npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy.js
npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/seed-exchange.js
```

## My thoughts
The deposit/trade smart contract design is a bit outdated, I guess it was designed before AMM pools were a thing.
Very instructive nonetheless and I'm very proud of what I've done with Dapp university!
Made with hardhart and react-redux which are industry standard, so that's good.
